# Churn-Prediction

This is a demo application that was used to understand different classification algorithms by using churn dataset from the network providers.
The classification models that were tested were Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and SVM's.
The accuracy for each of the models were calculated and cross validation was applied to the model with the highest accuracy. 
All the output files have been posted and the score with the higheset accuracy was recorded on Kaggle.
